# About

Hi - I'm [Sophia (aka fractal kitty)](https://fractalkitty.com/) and this is a temporary blog that I plan to learn 11ty with and journal as I go through a stretch and grow phase. I hope to dive in to some projects, learn new skills, and stretch my abilities.

Some of the things I hope to do in the next few months:
- Make a pico-8 game
- Learn 11ty
- Make a p5js library
- Make a generative quilt
- Do raspberry pi stuff
- Make a mastodon instance for my bot
- Learn a little Typescript
- Find a way to move my main blog off of Wordpress
- Take 3mo at the recurse center
- So much more...
